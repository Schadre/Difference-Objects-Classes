<h1 align="center"> üç£ Java Cuisine: Cooking Up Objects and Classes üç£ </h1>

<h2> What is a Class? </h2>
<p> Imagine a class as a recipe for your favorite dish, like a mouthwatering salmon dish(one of my personal favorites). The recipe lists all the ingredients you need and the steps to prepare and cook the dish. It's like a blueprint for creating something delicious.</p>
<p> In Java, a class is similar. It's a blueprint or template that defines what attributes (ingredients) and methods (steps) an object will have. For instance, if we have a class called SalmonDish, it might include attributes like ingredients (salmon, spices, lemon) and methods like prepare() and cook(). </p>

<h2>What is an Object? </h2>
<p>An object is like the actual dish you make using the recipe step by step. Once you have your recipe (class), you can use it to create a specific dish (object). For example, if you have a class SalmonDish, you can create an object that represents a specific salmon dish you are making.</p>

<h2>Conceptual Differences</h2>
<h3>Blueprint vs. Instance:</h3>
<ul><li><b>Class:</b> it‚Äôs a blueprint for creating objects like a recipe. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from the class will have.</li>
<li><b>Object:</b> it‚Äôs an instance of a class. It‚Äôs a concrete example that follows the blueprint provided by the class, like the actual dish you cook.</li></ul>
<h3>Definition vs. Creation:</h3>
<b>Class:</b> It‚Äôs the definition of what the object should be and do. Think of it as the recipe that tells you how to prepare and cook a salmon dish.
<b>Object:</b> It‚Äôs the creation based on the definition. It‚Äôs the actual salmon dish that you made using the recipe.

<h3>General vs. Specific:</h3>
<ul> <li> <b>Class:</b> (General) It provides a general structure for creating multiple objects. Just like one recipe can be used to make many salmon dishes.</li>
<li><b>Object:</b> (Specific) Each object is a specific instance with its own unique properties. Each salmon dish you cook might have slight variations, like a bit more lemon or an extra dash of spice.</li></ul>
